# donate_blood

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This donate blood application has a simple and user-friendly interface. The app starts with a splash screen and an onboarding screen that provides an explanation about the purpose of the app. Once the user has finished the onboarding process, they will be taken to the start screen where they can choose to sign up or log in.
The sign-up screen will prompt the user to provide their name, phone number, email address, password, location, blood type, and gender. Once the user has entered all of this information, they can click the sign-up button. If the user has already created an account, they can log in using their email and password. After logging in, the app will check if the user's account has been accepted, refused, or is still pending.
If the user's account has been accepted, they will be taken to the home screen. The home screen has three main sections - profile, appointments, and history. In the profile section, the user can view their personal information, including their name, phone number, email address, location, blood type, and gender. They can also edit their personal information by clicking on the edit profile button.
The appointment section allows the user to choose a hospital and select a date and time for their blood donation appointment. Once they have selected this information, it will be stored in Firestore. The history section allows the user to view their previous appointments and see the date and time they donated blood. All of this information is also stored in Firestore for easy access.
Overall, this donate blood application is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing users to donate blood with ease. The app provides a clear and understandable interface, making it easy for users to create an account, schedule appointments, and view their donation history. All the information is stored in Firestore, providing users with easy access to their information.
